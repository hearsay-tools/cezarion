# Workspace registry and per-user state (`~/.cezar/`)

[AGENTS.md § Task routing](../../AGENTS.md#task-routing) points here. Read this page before you change or review this area.

## Read first

`packages/cezar/src/paths.ts`, then `packages/cezar/src/workspace/config.ts`, `packages/cezar/src/workspace/projects.ts`, `packages/cezar/src/workspace/migrations.ts`, `packages/cezar/src/workspace/semaphore.ts`

## Rules

`~/.cezar/config.json` is the per-user workspace config **and** the project registry — every repo cezar has been booted in (spec `2026-07-20-multi-project-workspace`). Every path goes through `cezarHomeDir()` so `CEZ_HOME` keeps tests and containers off a real home; never re-derive `homedir()` elsewhere. Schema rules are load-bearing: every field optional with `.catch`, `.passthrough()` at every object level, per-entry salvage for `projects` (one bad row never evicts the registry), and writes only through `mergeWriteWorkspaceConfig` (read-modify-write + atomic tmp/rename, `0600`) so two processes converge. A corrupt or read-only home degrades to in-memory defaults with ONE warning — never a boot failure. Migrations are config-files-only, idempotent, additive and non-blocking; run state never migrates. `maxParallel`/`memoryLimitMb` are workspace-wide (`resources`): the per-repo keys are imported once by migration 001 and ignored by enforcement afterwards. Registration is suppressed for task worktrees and `$HOME` itself (`shouldRegisterProject`). A merge-write resolves its path ONCE and uses it for both halves — resolving it twice let a `CEZ_HOME` that changed mid-flight read one home and write another, wiping the user's registry. Two guards back that up: `assertCezarHomeWriteIsSandboxed` refuses any write into the real `~/.cezar` from a vitest process, and `packages/cezar/vitest.setup.ts` pins `CEZ_HOME` to a per-worker sandbox so no case ever runs unpinned. Every write that leaves projects behind also snapshots `config.json.bak`, which `loadWorkspaceConfig` restores from when the config is missing, empty or corrupt (a config that parses and is simply empty is the user's own state and is never overridden).

**Agent accounts** (spec `2026-07-29-agent-profiles`) live in this directory too, but in their OWN file — `~/.cezar/agent-accounts.json`, never a key in `config.json`, so a cezar that has never heard of accounts cannot drop them; `src/workspace/agent-accounts.ts` owns the store, `src/core/agent-profiles.ts` the vendor knowledge and `src/workspace/agent-profiles.ts` the resolution.
