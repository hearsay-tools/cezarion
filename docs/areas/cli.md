# CLI entry and subcommands

[AGENTS.md § Task routing](../../AGENTS.md#task-routing) points here. Read this page before you change or review this area.

## Read first

`packages/cezar/src/index.ts`

## Rules

Uses `node:util` `parseArgs`, no CLI framework. `serve` is the default command. Headless `run` treats `review` as a terminal success status (exit 0). `serve` boots in a fixed order: bind the listener, open the boot store and build its `RunManager`, `recover()` the boot project, then `startServer`. So anything a recovered run needs (its cockpit address, for one) must reach the boot manager at construction, not from `startServer`. `init` never overwrites existing files. Keep `.ai/cezar/.gitignore` maintenance (`ensureDataGitignore`) in sync with any new state file.
